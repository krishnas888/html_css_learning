1. Adjacent Sibling Selector

h1 + a is an adjacent sibling selector.

Selects all <a> elements that are the immediate sibling of an <h1> element.

Meaning, the <a> element must come directly after the <h1> element, with no other elements in between.

To style elements based on their relationship to each other.

To create specific layout structures.

css style
h1 + a {
    color:red
}

html:
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<a href="#">Link</a>

In this example, the a element would not be selected because it's not the immediate sibling of the h1 element. A paragraph element comes in between.

2. General Sibling Selector

Selects all <button> elements that are siblings of a <textarea> element.

Unlike the adjacent sibling selector (+), this selector matches any <button> element that comes after the <textarea>, regardless of other elements in between.

To style elements based on their relationship to each other.

When you want to target multiple sibling elements after a specific element.

css style
textarea ~ button {
    color:red
}

html:
<textarea></textarea>
<p>Some text</p>
<button>Click me</button>

note:
In this case, the <button> element would be selected because it's a sibling of the <textarea> element, even though there's a <p> element in between.

3. Child Selector

Selects all <li> elements that are direct children of a <ul> element.

This means it only selects <li> elements that are immediate descendants of <ul>, not grandchildren or further nested elements.

To style elements based on their parent-child relationship.

To create specific styling for direct children of a particular element.

css style
ul > li {
    color:red
}

4. desent selecor

Selects all <li> elements that are descendants of a <ul> element.

This includes not only direct children but also grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and so on.

To style elements based on their relationship to other elements.

When you want to apply styles to all elements of a certain type within a specific container.

ul li{
    color:green
}
