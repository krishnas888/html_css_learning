CSS Stands fro Cascading Sttyle Sheet.

It is a language used to give styling and design to websites.

It is the standard for styling websites, used by most/all websites across the globe.

Its usually goes hand-in-hand with HTML, while CSS3
(the latest version) brings lots of new features to the table.

CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.

CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.


What Are Frameworks?

A framework is a premeditated set of concepts, modules, and standardized
criteria that make the task of developing web sites and web applications
easier.

Usually, there are two kinds of frameworks.
• Front-end frameworks (CSS and JavaScript frameworks).
• Back-end or server-side programming frameworks.

NOTE:
    While back-end frameworks are used by web developers and
programmers to build applications on the server-side, front-end
frameworks are used by web designers and developers for implementing the Cascading Style Sheets language.

Components of a CSS Framework:

• Grids (structures that help organize the content and
design the layout)
• Typography elements
• Cross-browser compatibility
• Helper classes for positioning elements
• Utility classes
• Navigational elements
• Source code written in preprocessors such as Sass
and LESS
• Media elements (badges, tooltips, comments,
and so on)

• Clean and consistent coding
• Cross-browser compatibility
• Grid-based design
• The ability to incorporate healthy coding practices
• Easy-to-build prototypes
• Easy maintenance and upkeep
• Allows reuse and clean homogenous code structure
• Easy expandability and modifications
