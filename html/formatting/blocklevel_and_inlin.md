Block Level elements
Block-level elements are those that take up the full width available, and they always start on a new line. They are like building blocks in a web page layout. 

**Characteristics of Block-Level Elements:**
- They start on a new line.
- They take up the full width available, stretching out to the left and right as far as they can.
- They can contain other block-level elements and inline elements.

- `<div>`
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`
- `<p>`: 
- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>`
- `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<nav>`


Inline Elemets 
Inline elements do not start on a new line. Instead, they appear "in line" with the surrounding content. They are like pieces of text within a paragraph.

**Characteristics of Inline Elements:**
- They do not start on a new line.
- They take up only as much width as necessary.
- They can contain other inline elements and text but not block-level elements.

`<span>`
 `<a>`
 `<strong>` and `<em>` 
 `<img>`
`<br>`
